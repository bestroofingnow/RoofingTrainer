Research	Pull storm‑date + parcel owner, check CRM history	30 s
Ring	Use local‑presence dialer; smile before dialing	—
Rapport	“Mrs. Douglas? This is Alex with Best Roofing Now here in Charlotte—we’re neighbors up on Brookline.”	15 s
Reason	Reference specific weather event / age trigger: “That March 18th hail‑cell hit your block with 1.5″ stones; many roofs built before 2010 like yours lost granules.”	20 s
Reassure	Social proof & license: “We’re GAF Certified, A+ BBB, and we helped 27 families on Amber Court last spring—at no cost beyond their deductible.”	15 s
Request	“I’ll be in the neighborhood tomorrow at 4 or Friday at 10. Which works for your complimentary 15‑min roof health check?”	Close

5. Script Library
TIPS:
Read, don’t recite—mark scripts with pauses / emphasis.
Mirror pace and tone.
Document verbatim objections for coaching.

5.1 Post‑Storm Same‑Day Script
pgsql
Copy
Opener:  Hi, may I speak with __?  (pause)  
          __, I’m <NAME> calling from Best Roofing Now on a quick safety check.  
Trigger:  The hail storm that rolled through [CITY] around 2 p.m. dropped stones the size of quarters.  
Value:    We’re offering complimentary, no‑contact roof scans with drone photos so you can see exactly what happened up there.   
CTA:      I have two inspection slots open—tomorrow at 6 p.m. or Saturday at 9 a.m. Which is better for you?
Compliance Statement (if asked): We’re licensed, insured, and never ask you to sign anything until you’ve seen clear evidence of damage—promise.  
5.2 Annual Roof‑Wellness Call (Retail)
pgsql
Copy
Reason: Your roof just turned 13 this spring—national data shows shingles that age develop sealing fatigue in NC’s humidity.  
Offer:  Our 21‑point wellness check catches issues before they cost thousands in interior leaks.  
Bonus:  Appointment includes free gutter flow test and photo report.  
Objection‑Bypass: “I’m not seeing leaks.” — Absolutely. Most leaks hide 6‑12 months before they drip indoors; that’s why the check is preventative.  
5.3 Voicemail Template
pgsql
Copy
Hi __, this is <NAME> with Best Roofing Now.  
I’m calling about yesterday’s hail on Ridge Rd—roofs there took up to 1¼‑inch impact.  
I’ll email a before‑and‑after satellite photo so you can decide if a no‑cost scan makes sense.  
Call or text 704‑555‑0123. Again, 704‑555‑0123.  
Stay safe!
5.4 Gatekeeper Script (Spouse / Adult Child)
pgsql
Copy
I understand Mr. Lee makes the maintenance decisions. Could you help me schedule a **brief** inspection window so he has accurate photos to review? I’ll copy you both on the report.
5.5 Insurance‑Assistance Call
pgsql
Copy
Need:  Many carriers now require photo evidence within 365 days—after that, coverage can lapse.  
Hook: We document damage in the carrier‑approved Xactimate format, so adjusters rarely need second trips.  
Ethics:  We can’t—and won’t—waive deductibles, but 90 % of our NC clients pay only that amount for full replacement.  
6. Objection Playbook (FLASH cards)
Objection	Talk‑Track
“We already had someone look.”	“Great—what did they find? I often provide a second opinion and catch items missed, especially on ventilation—which insurers require but many roofers skip.”
“I’m not filing a claim; rates will skyrocket.”	“NC carriers can’t increase premiums for a single act‑of‑God claim. Long‑term, ignoring hidden damage creates out‑of‑pocket costs that aren’t insurable.”
“No money for a roof.”	“If it’s storm‑related, your policy—not your wallet—funds the work, minus the deductible. For retail upgrades we partner with Service Finance—$0 down.”
“Send something in writing.”	“Absolutely—expect an email with my license, BBB link, and a one‑page inspection overview in the next 5 minutes. May I confirm your address?”

7. KPI Dashboard & Gamification

Closing Thought
Cold calling done the Best Roofing Now way is not “selling roofs”—it is educating and protecting neighbors. When reps combine technical knowledge, ethical conduct, and disciplined call practice, appointments (and satisfied homeowners) follow naturally.
